# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge

A popular coding challange that I used to learn how to test using Jest.

The instructions for the challenge are as follows:  

Write a program that outputs the numbers 1 to 100, however:

1) If the number is a multiple of 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.
2) If the number is a multiple of 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.
3) For the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
